    <p>
      Mancala is a two-player turn-based game. On your turn, pick up all stones from one
      of your pits and sow them one-by-one into the following pits in a counter-clockwise
      direction. If the last stone lands in your store, you get another turn. Capture occurs
      when the last stone lands in an empty pit on your side — capture that stone and the
      stones opposite into your store.
    </p>
